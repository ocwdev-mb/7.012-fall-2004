  caption: "Electron micrograph showing transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes\
    \ in the developing egg cell of the spotted newt. Fibers extending in clusters\
    \ are molecules of rRNA used in the construction of cell's ribosomes. The long\
    \ filaments indicated by green arrow are DNA molecules coated with proteins. RNA\
    \ molecules get longer as transcription proceeds to completion as indicated by\
    \ the red arrow.\_(Courtesy of\_[Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov/)\
