description: Electron micrograph showing transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes
  in the developing egg cell of the spotted newt. Fibers extending in clusters are
  molecules of rRNA used in the construction of cell's ribosomes. The long filaments
  indicated by green arrow are DNA molecules coated with proteins. RNA molecules get
  longer as transcription proceeds to completion as indicated by the red arrow. (Courtesy
